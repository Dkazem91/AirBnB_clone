#AirBnB Clone Project#
##Part 1 - command interpreter##
###This project will entail:###
* Putting in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
* Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Creating all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place…`) that inherit from `BaseModel`
* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
